Inheritance Mapping models
Inheritance Mappings refers to mapping an inheritance relationship between the entity classes into the relational database tables

class InsurancePlan {
	int insurancePlanNo;
	String planName;
	String description;
	int taxSaver;
	double minInsurredAmount;
	double maxInsurredAmount;
	// accessors
}

class AccidentalInsurancePlan extends InsurancePlan {
	String coverageType;
	double disabilityCoveragePercentage;
	// accessors
}

class MedicalInsurancePlan extends InsurancePlan {
	String networkCoverage;
	int copay;
	// accessors
}

There are 3 ways we can map an inheritance relationship between the entity classes into relational database tables
1. Table per class hierarchy
For all the classes within the inheritance hierarchy, we will create only one single table with columns as representing attributes of all the classes of the hierarchy.
	
2. Table per subclass
Per each subclass in the inheritance hierarchy, create a separate table representing the subclass, in relationship with super class table

3. Table per concreate class
Per each concreate class within the hierarchy create individual tables with parent/subclass attributes
