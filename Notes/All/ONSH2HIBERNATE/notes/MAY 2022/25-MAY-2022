There are 3 ways an inheritance relationship between the entity classes can be mapped into the database tables
1. Table per class hierarchy	= For all the classes within the inheritance hierarchy we create one single table
2. Table per subclass = Per each subclass within the hierarchy we create a separate table in relationship with superclass table
3. Table per concreate class = per each concreate class within the hierarchy create a separate table including the inherited attributes, representing them as columns in their tables
	
Let us explore by choosing each strategy how can we perform persistence operation on the underlying tables

#1. Table per class hierarchy
For all the classes within the inheritance hierarchy create one-single table representing all the attributes of the entire hierarchy of classes as columns within that table
