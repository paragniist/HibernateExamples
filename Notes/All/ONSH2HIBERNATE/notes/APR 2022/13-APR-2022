What is a Service?
Service is a component that provides functionality. For various different functionalities we will have different Service interfaces to define the contract of the functionality, these interfaces are called "ServiceRole" interfaces. The Frameworks are designed to consume these Services by using interface and implementation.
	
Hibernate Framework has defined several ServiceRole interfaces to expose pluggability of various different Resources/Functionalities into the Hibernate Framework. People can build their own implements for these ServiceRole Interfaces and plugin into the Hibernate Framework for extensibility or customization.
	
These services are hosted and managed by the ServiceRegistry. There are 2 responsibilities of Service Registries
	1. Lifecycle management
	2. dependency management
