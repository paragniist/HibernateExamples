ORM
----
object relational mapping technology is about how to map the relational database table data into a class object. while storing the data in database tables, they have relationship with another tables. So, while querying the data we get data of table and its related table data as well, now how to map the data of table along with its related table records as well?

In order to map table with relationship data into class objects, we need to understand how to establish relationship between classes as well, then we can identify which type of relationship between the tables can be mapped into which class relationship easily.
	
So, let us explore how to establish relationship between classes:


Why does the classes has to be related with each other?
There are 2 reasons why a class wants to establish relationship with another class.
	1. to reuse the functionality of another object
	2. to relate or establish relationship between the data of the objects
	
below is the example depicting a class wants to reuse the data of another object	
class Person {
	int personNo;
	String personName;
	int age;
	String gender;
	Address address;
	// accessors
}

class Passport {
	String passportNo;
	String passportHolderName;
	Date dob;
	String gender;
	Date issuedDate;
	Date expiryDate;
	Address address;
	
}

class Address {
	String addressLine1;
	String addressLine2;
	String city;
	String state;
	int zip;
	String country;

}

How many ways we can establish relationship between the classes?
There are 2 ways we can establish relationship between the classes
1. Inheritance
2. Association

#1. Inheritance
Inheritance represents is-a relationship between the classes. If we want all the traits of another class within our class then we need to use Inheritance. There are 3 forms of Inheritance are there
1.1 Generalization
1.2 Specialization
1.3 Realization


1.1 Generalization
