There are 3 types of relationships we can establish between database tables
1. one-to-one
2. one-to-many or many-to-one
3. many-to-many

#1. one-to-one relationship
2 tables are said to be in one-to-one relationship with each other when one record a table is in relationship with only one record of the another table
there are 2 ways we can represent one-to-one relationship between the tables
	1.1 direct one-to-one
		1. The record in table doesnt have existence without the record primary key table
		2. There is no independent identity of the record in the 2nd table 
		
		then we establish one-to-one relationship by writing primary key of the table as a primary key and foreign key in another table
		
	1.2 one-to-many as one-to-one
		1. Each of the entities has their own identity
		2. Each of the entities can exists independent of each other 
		
		then we need have each table a separate primary key then we should writing primary key of a table as foregin key in another table and to make this relationship one-to-one we have to make foregin key as unique
		
#2. one-to-many relationship
a record in one table is in relationship with multiple records of another table, then the relationship is said to be in one-to-many
write the primary key of one table as a foreign key in another table

#3. many-to-many relationship
many records of a table or in relationship with many records of the another table
