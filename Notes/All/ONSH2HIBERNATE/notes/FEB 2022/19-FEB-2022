Normalization
--------------
always while storing the data into the database tables we need to normalize the data otherwise we run into insertion/delete/updating anomolies

In order to identify and distribute the data across the tables, EF Codd has introduced normal forms.
Normalization is a technic of breaking down the data and distribute across multiple tables to effectively store the data in database.
There are total 5 Normal forms are there each of them defined with set of rules that should be applied on the data to Normalize
1. 1NF
2. 2NF
3. 3NF
------------------------------
4. BCNF (Boy Cott Normal Form)
5. 5NF

Each of these Normal Forms has to be applied sequentially one on top of another begining from 1st NF to 5th, unless we applied 1NF we cannot apply 2NF rules on the data to normalize.	
In order for a give data to be normalized atleast we need to apply till 3NF.
	
#1. 1NF
--------
1. No Repeating groups of data
2. Each field in the table should be atomic in nature
3. Every table must have a primary key

What is repeating groups of data?
For a group of fields in the table, the other fields of the table should be stored repeatedly.

#2. 2NF
---------
1. Your data model should be already in 1NF
2. all the non-key attributes of your table should be fully dependent on all the parts of the key
3. every table must and should have primary key
