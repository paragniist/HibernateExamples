Normalization
--------------
As part of a business there is an huge amount of data being generated, all of the data has to be stored for future usage in the database.
	
Can we store all of the business data within a single table inside the database?
Yes we can store it but we will run into lot of anomolies (problems)
	1. insertion anomoly
	2. updation anomoly
	3. deletion anomoly
	
so we need to break the data and distribute across multiple tables so that we can easily manage the data and can avoid data redundancy and anomolies in storing the data
How to identify and break the data into multiple tables?
To help us in easily identifying and grouping the data into tables, Normalization has been introduced by EF Codd. 
Normalization is set of rules defined, which we have to following in designing the database tables for storing the data.

There are total 5 Normal Forms are there
1. 1st Normal Form
2. 2nd Normal Form
3. 3rd Normal Form
4. Boyy Cott Normal Form (bcnf)
5. 5th Normal Form
