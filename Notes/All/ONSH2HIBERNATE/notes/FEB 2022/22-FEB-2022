Join queries
------------
Since the data has been normalized and distributed across multiple tables, inorder to query the data across the tables we need join the tables together.
	
In order to join the data across the tables we need to use primary key and foreign key of the tables to match	records across the tables.

1. Inner join
2. Left outer join
3. Right outer join
