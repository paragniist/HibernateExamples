How many ways we can establish relationship between the tables?
There are 3 types of relationships we can establish between the tables
1. one-to-one
2. one-to-many or many-to-one
3. many-to-many

#1. one-to-one
a record in one table is in relationship with only one record of another table then the tables are said to be in one-to-one relationship
There are 2 ways we can establish one-to-one relationship between the tables
	1.1. direct one-to-one relationship
	1.2. one-to-many as one-to-one

1.2 one-to-many as one-to-one
For any given 2 tables we establish one-to-many as one-to-one relationship given
	1. if both the tables has their own identity (primary key)
	2. we need to decide the owner of the relationship to identify which side primary key has to be written as foreign key in another table
	
by writing foreign key in another table the 2 tables will get into one-to-many relationship to make them act as one-to-one relationship we need to make foreign key column as unique.
