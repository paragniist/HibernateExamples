How to persist the association relationship in relational model?
since it is one-to-many relationship, we need to store primary key of account entity class into foreign key of address to establish relationship. For any one-to-many association to persist the relationship we need to do the same operation

How to fetch the association?
take the primary key of account object and match with foreign key of address table to identify which address belongs to this account. For every one-to-many association to fetch the associated objects we need to perform same operation

This is well-known to hibernate/jpa api. To hibernate framework/jpa api we dont need to tell what operation should be perform to store/retrieve. we only need to tell 2 things
1. relationship Type
2. foreign key column
	
<set name="addresses">
	<key column="account_no" not-null="false"/> #foreign key column
	<one-to-many class="Address"/> #my entity class is in which type of relationship
</set>
