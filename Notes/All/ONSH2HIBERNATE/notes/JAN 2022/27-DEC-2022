#5. No-Sql or Semi-Structured databases
RDBMS supports storing structured data as part of the database tables. It is not recommended to store semi-structured and non-relational data as apart of RDBMS database as we run into quite a number of problems:

What is semi-structured data?
For a given data/information the fields will vary record by records
(or)
Not all the records of data has same set of fields, different records has various differents fields of data

#1. designing the database schema is very complex for storing semi-structured data
#2. programmer has to write complex logic in managing and persisting the data into databases tables when we are storing semi-structured data
#3. un-necessary joins between the tables as we converted fields/columns of the table into records in another table, so query operations will results in poor performance and more usage of cpu/ram
#4. query filtering/searching and accessing the data becomes very heavy due to more records of data to be filtered
#5. we use relationship columns for co-relating the data which doesnt make any sense
