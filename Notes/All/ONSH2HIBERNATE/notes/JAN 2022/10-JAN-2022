How to store the data permanently on a storage device of a computer?
We can store the data on the permanent storage device of a computer using File Sytem technics interms of Files/Folder on a computer.

File: File is a named logical memory location where group of data stored in terms of characters/bytes which can read/accessed uniquely
Folder: Collection of Files grouped to gether to quickly locate and access is called a Folder

How to store the data in Files?
We can store the data in files interms of text/sequence of characters inside it. when we store the business data in the files, we can read it and understand, but we wanted programs/software applications to read and process the data that is stored in the Files.
	
Programs cannot understand the data that is stored interms of text of characters as programs cannot interpret natural/human language so we need to store the data in the file in a format where humans and programs also should be able understand and perform operations that where we have 2 formats of storing the data

1. Human understandable format
2. programmable/machine understand format

How to store the data in programmable or machine understandable format?
There are experts in the market performing research on how can we effectively store the data on a File so that programs can also read and perform operation and has introduced several forms of storing the data, let us explore those formats

Business data usually contains multiple fields of information, instead of capturing the data in a natural language, if we can extract those fields of data and store in a specific format in a file, then we can program the data.
	

1. Fixed width field size format (FWFSF)
In Fixed width field size format, each field of information is assigned a fixed width using which we store the data in a specific order of fields
Rules:-
	1. all the records should have same set of fields
	2. For each record the fields should be stored in same order
	3. Each field should be given fixed size
for eg in a sale record we have below fields defined with each field size as shown below	
customername = 12
sale_dt = 10
quantity = 3
total_amount = 5
discount = 3
paid_amount = 5
--------------------
	            38 * 200 = 7900
---------------------
based on above semantics or data definition we can store the data in below format on the file

jack        07/01/20220120180018001620 
stephen     08/01/20220330239923002169

replace jack with jackson

		
Now we can write program in java which can read each record and extract the fields of data based on the field sizes and perform operation

advantages:-
	1. the data is both human and machine understandable format
	2. it supports both sequential and random access of the data, at any point of time we can jump onto a specific record in the file and can read it because each record has fixed set of characters in length
	3. modifying the field of information is very easy since each field has fixed in size

dis-advantages:-
	1. huge amount of memory is wasted because of fixed width
	2.
