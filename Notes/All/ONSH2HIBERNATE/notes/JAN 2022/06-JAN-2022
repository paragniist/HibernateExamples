What is Persistency why do we need to persist the data permanently on a storage device of a computer?	
Persistency is all about permanently storing the data on a secondary storage (Harddisk) device of a computer system, so that it can accessed and used at later point of time.	
	
Kirana store
# with more quality and production availability and fair price of the products
- more customers started walking into the store
	# expanded the store and production varieties to meet increasing customers
	# along with that I added more staff also to help/guide customers in their shopping
		- more customers has been added, so that reputation of the business has been increased 
	due to the increasing shopping cart and quantity of purchase it is taking more time for billing the products and collecting the amount from the customers, due to manually writing the bill and calculating
	
	Calculator = Is the first computing device introduced into the world in helping perform mathematical operations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now by adding Calculator to the store, it became a revolutionary thing in helping store/business man in conducting the business
	- faster calculations
	- higher accuracy
in conducting the operations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	With faster services being offered, now more number of customers started coming to the store and purchaing more volumes of products
	
To hold and perform billing operations with volumes of products for the customers we need a memory for the calculator through which we can keep track of the data we fed asking the calculator to perform operations, so that we can avoid manually writing the product prices on a piece of papper to keep track and enter into calculator.
Calculator + Check buttons are introduced
